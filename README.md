# Google API Workshop
> Learn about Google APIs through the Google Calendar API

## Get Started
If you do not already have one, create a Google account. You should also have Python installed on your computer in order to create a localhost server.

## Uses
The Google Calendar API can be used to read, create, and edit both personal and public Google Calendars through apps. Although this workshop is about the Google Calendar API, it will hopefully give you the basics needed to use other Google APIs like the Sheets or Docs APIs. All of these APIs can help you integrate Google services into your programs.

## Purpose
This workshop will cover the Google Calendar API and creating a python localhost server.

## Goal
Create a basic website that creates customizable events on a Google Calendar.

## Challenges

 1. Create the Quickstart from Google Calendar's Docs
 2. Localhost the files with python
 3. Edit the quickstart to make custom events
